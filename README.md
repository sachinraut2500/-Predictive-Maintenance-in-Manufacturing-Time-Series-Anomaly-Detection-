# 🛠️ Predictive Maintenance using LSTM Autoencoder

This project simulates real-time sensor data from manufacturing equipment and uses an LSTM autoencoder to detect potential machinery failure.

---

## 🚧 Problem Statement

Predict when a machine might fail by monitoring its vibration signals and detecting anomalies in its behavior.

---

## 📦 Features

- Synthetic time series simulating vibration sensor data
- Autoencoder built with LSTM to learn normal patterns
- Anomaly detection based on reconstruction error
- Visualization of error and threshold line

---

## 📊 Libraries

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
